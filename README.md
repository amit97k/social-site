# social-site
### DBMS project

In this project , i tried to built a social networking site with some features like chat box , image uploading , view profile ,
update profile, and one common chat box for all where anyone can post a problem and get the solution by the other users. 
Since it is a institution site so only institute students and faculty can join it. we also provide the security in password using MD5 hash
function which encrypt the password before stored in the table.
